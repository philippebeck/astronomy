On the way, Helle fell into the sea & drowned on the border of Europe & Asia, in a place called Hellespont, or Mer de Helle, today the Dardanelles.

Chronos devouring all his children, Rhea, his wife, saved the last-born by entrusting him to a nymph & giving his father a stone to devour in his place. One day, playing with Amalthea, one of its immense horns remained in the hands of Zeus who offered it in recognition to the nymph like the Horn of Plenty. Whenever she wished, she found fruit & ambrosia there. Zeus then joined Olympia to avenge his brothers by overthrowing his father. It is the demi-god Pan, son of Hermes, who received his name from the gods because he liked everyone from birth.

('corvus',              'When Apollo asked his raven to take a sweet note from his beloved Coronis, daughter of Phlégyas & mother of Doctor Aesculapius, the latter stopped at a fig tree to eat the fruits. On his return, he took a water snake between his legs & told his master that this animal had prevented him from reaching the water source, which explains his delay. But nothing can be hidden from the god of truth, & to punish him, Apollo condemned him to no longer be able to satiate himself at the sources as long as the fig remained hanging on the tree. The god carried the Crow, the Cup & the Female Hydra (water snake) to the heavens to remember forever what it would cost him to lie to him.'),

Also depicts the dragon Ladon whom Heracles killed to take the golden apples from the garden of the Hesperides, the three daughters of Atlas, of which the dragon had custody. Potatoes were the wedding gift of Gaia, Earth & Hera, and they conferred immortality. Hera wanted to honor the occult dragon by transforming it into a constellation.

Zeus therefore brought the newborn to Olympus & placed it on Hera chest, he had fallen asleep.

('ophiuchus',           'Ophiucus means "the one who holds the serpent". This refers to Asclepius who became the god of Aesculapius medicine in Roman mythology. An epidemic having broken out, messengers had been sent to Delphi to consult the oracle. The latter advised to take one of the two snakes which formed the caduceus, emblem of the god, & to transport it from Epidaurus to Rome. Aesculapius, son of Apollo & Coronis, was trained in the medical art by the centaur Chiron & became a great doctor capable of raising the dead. The snake represents his sagacity or perhaps his miraculous capacity to save the victims of poisonous animals, which was not to the liking of Zeus, who struck him.'),
('orion',               'Orion was the son of Poseidon & Euryale, one of the Gorgons. A giant hunter who boasted that he could kill any creature on Earth, Orion challenged the goddess Artemis, daughter of Zeus, to hunt.

Perseus then mounted the winged horse to deliver Andromeda chained to his rock. It was also on Pegasus back that Bellerophon, descendant of the Corinthian kings, succeeded in defeating the Chimera, a lion-headed monster, with the body of a goat & the snake tail, which spat out flames. After his victory, pride made him commit an unforgivable fault: he decided to climb with Pegasus towards Olympus. Pegasus disturbs him & continues alone until the stay of the gods, while Bellerophon is thrown to the ground. He spent the rest of his life there, crippled and lonely, like a proscribed & a reprobate.'),
('perseus',             'Perseus was the son of Danae & Zeus who loved her in the form of a golden shower. Perseus succeeds in cutting off the head of Medusa, the Gorgon whose gaze was so piercing that no one could look at him without turning into stone, using the polished bronze shield of Athena, shining like a mirror. Stheno, Euryale and Medusa, were the three Gorgons, sisters of the three Grees. Medusa was the only mortal Gorgon & Poseidon fell in love with it. He dragged her one night to the temple of Athena & the offended goddess turned the girl into a sparkling-eyed, snake-haired monster. When Medusa was killed by Perseus & his head was cut, the two creatures spawned by Poseidon came out of his neck: Pegasus, the winged horse & Chrysaor, the man with the golden sword. On the way back, riding Pegasus, Perseus saw Andromède chained to a rock and threatened to be devoured by a sea monster, the whale. Armed with his trophy, Perseus petrified the sea monster by presenting him with the severed head of Medusa. He delivered Andromède, whom he married.

The Phoenix, according to what Herodotus or Plutarch reported, is a mythical bird of Ethiopian origin, of extraordinary longevity, & which has the power, after being consumed at a stake, to be reborn from the ashes. When the hour of his death approaches, he builds himself a nest of fragrant twigs where he burns his own heat. From the ashes of the phoenix was born a new phoenix. The aspects of symbolism therefore appear clearly: immortality & cyclical resurgence.'),

('sagittarius',         'A giant archer, Sagittarius is associated with Chiron, the half-man, half-horse, centaur whom we represent holding a taut bow. Immortal, wise & beneficent centaur, Chiron is a friend of men. He teaches them morals, music & medicine. Achille, his protected, having been accidentally burned, Chiron treats his injured ankle and thanks to this operation, Achille becomes an extraordinary runner. Subsequently, Chiron comes to the aid of Heracles, who fights a troop of wild mountain centaurs. Thirsty and attracted by the smell of the wine that Heracles drinks, they arrive armed with rocks & pines. The deadly arrow shot by Heracles accidentally hit Chiron in the knee. His suffering is excruciating, the wound is incurable. Chiron being a god, he cannot die. Zeus then welcomes him into the stars for eternity'),
